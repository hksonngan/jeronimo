	The vertex normals are smoother than the normals of the subdivision

	how to apply subdivision to normals and how blend and combine different
	normals for achieving a variety of effects.},

  abstract = {In recent years a considerable amount of work in graphics and geometric
	optimization used tools based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator on
	a surface. The applications of the Laplacian include mesh editing,
	surface smoothing, and shape interpolations among others. However,
	it has been shown [13, 24, 26] that the popular cotangent approximation
	schemes do not provide convergent point-wise (or even L2) estimates,
	while many applications rely on point-wise estimation. Existence
	of such schemes has been an open question [13].
	
	
	In this paper we propose the first algorithm for approximating the
	Laplace operator of a surface from a mesh with point-wise convergence
	guarantees applicable to arbitrary meshed surfaces. We show that
	for a sufficiently fine mesh over an arbitrary surface, our mesh
	Laplacian is close to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the surface
	at every point of the surface.
	
	
	Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easily implementable.
	Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm exhibits convergence
	empirically and compares favorably with cotangentbased methods in
	providing accurate approximation of the Laplace operator for various
	meshes.},

  abstract = {Uniform offsetting is an important geometric operation for computer-aided
	design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications such as rapid prototyping,
	NC machining, coordinate measuring machines, robot collision avoidance,
	and Hausdorff error calculation. We present a novel method for offsetting
	(grown and shrunk) a solid model by an arbitrary distance r. First,
	offset polygons are directly computed for each face, edge, and vertex
	of an input solid model. The computed polygonal meshes form a continuous
	boundary; however, such a boundary is invalid since there exist meshes
	that are closer to the original model than the given distance r as
	well as self-intersections. Based on the problematic polygonal meshes,
	we construct a well-structured point-based model, Layered Depth-Normal
	Image (LDNI), in three orthogonal directions. The accuracy of the
	generated point-based model can be controlled by setting the tessellation
	and sampling rates during the construction process. We then process
	all the sampling points in the model by using a set of point filters
	to delete all the invalid points. Based on the remaining points,
	we construct a two-manifold polygonal contour as the resulting offset
	boundary. Our method is general, simple and efficient. We report
	experimental results on a variety of CAD models and discuss various
	applications of the developed uniform offsetting method.},

  abstract = {Quadratic elements place stringent requirements on a surface mesh
	smoother. One of the biggest challenges is that a good linear element
	may become invalid when mid-side nodes are introduced. To help alleviate
	this problem, a new objective function for optimization-based smoothing
	is proposed for triangular and quadrilateral elements, linear or
	quadratic. Unlike the current popular approaches, this objective
	function makes it possible for a smoothing algorithm to untangle
	and smooth in a single process. This objective function has higher
	order continuous derivatives and only one minimum, if any, that make
	it suitable for optimization techniques. Even though optimization-based
	smoothing obtains much higher quality results compared to other algorithms,
	such as constrained Laplacian smoothing, it is also slower than these
	algorithms. That said, we also present an effective way to limit
	the number of calls to optimization-based smoothing such that the
	highest quality mesh is obtained in the least amount of time.},

  abstract = {This paper systematically studies the well-known Mexican hat wavelet
	(MHW) on manifold geometry, including its derivation, properties,
	transforms, and applications. The MHW is rigorously derived from
	the heat kernel by taking the negative first-order derivative with
	respect to time. As a solution to the heat equation, it has a clear
	initial condition: the Laplace?Beltrami operator. Following a popular
	methodology in mathematics, we analyze the MHW and its transforms
	from a Fourier perspective. By formulating Fourier transforms of
	bivariate kernels and convolutions, we obtain its explicit expression
	in the Fourier domain, which is a scaled differential operator continuously
	dilated via heat diffusion. The MHW is localized in both space and
	frequency, which enables space-frequency analysis of input functions.
	We defined its continuous and discrete transforms as convolutions
	of bivariate kernels, and propose a fast method to compute convolutions
	by Fourier transform. To broaden its application scope, we apply
	the MHW to graphics problems of feature detection and geometry processing.},

  abstract = {A technique for merging freeform objects modeled with subdivision

	the vicinity of the blend region is refined and the boundary curves
	of the blend region are smoothed to reduce possible distortion in
	the blending surface. A blend curve between the two surfaces is used
	for connecting the given surfaces. Vertices on the blend curve are
	regular whereas extraordinary vertices are restricted to locate along
	the boundary of the blend region. Locations of the blend vertices
	are adjusted such that the curvature of the surfaces along the boundaries
	of the blend region is minimized. This ensures extraordinary vertices

	and surface modeling. Most of the previous smoothing approaches are
	however, mainly designed for triangular meshes. This paper proposes
	a unified approach to address fairing problems of arbitrary polygonal

	of a smoothed mesh locate on its noise-free surface and remain unchanged
	during the smoothing process in order to prevent the resulted mesh
	from shrinkage and preserve surface features. Boundary smoothing
	is considered in a similar way as well but the process is independent
	to mesh processing such that two, noisy meshes sharing a boundary
	still adjoin continuously after smoothing. Finally, a Taubin-like
	inflation operator is employed to further improve the ability of
	anti-shrinkage. Although very simple iterative equation is employed
	in the smoothing procedure, experiments demonstrate that the approach
	is able to not only effectively address the problem of shrinkage
	and distortion but also preserve features very well.},

	surface to be preserved as much as possible. We argue that geometric
	detail is an intrinsic property of a surface and that, consequently,
	surface editing is best performed by operating over an intrinsic
	surface representation. We provide such a representation of a surface,
	based on the Laplacian of the mesh, by encoding each vertex relative
	to its neighborhood. The Laplacian of the mesh is enhanced to be
	invariant to locally linearized rigid transformations and scaling.
	Based on this Laplacian representation, we develop useful editing
	operations: interactive free-form deformation in a region of interest
	based on the transformation of a handle, transfer and mixing of geometric
	details between two surfaces, and transplanting of a partial surface
	mesh onto another surface. The main computation involved in all operations
	is the solution of a sparse linear system, which can be done at interactive
	rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several
	examples, showing that the editing operations change the shape while
	respecting the structural geometric detail.},

	With a given coarse mesh more and more details will be added to the

	the volume inside the input mesh. The graph need not form a solid
	meshing of the input mesh's interior; its edges simply connect nearby
	points in the volume. This graph's Laplacian encodes volumetric details
	as the difference between each point in the graph and the average
	of its neighbors. Preserving these volumetric details during deformation
	imposes a volumetric constraint that prevents unnatural changes in
	volume. We also include in the graph points a short distance outside
	the mesh to avoid local self-intersections. Volumetric detail preservation
	is represented by a quadric energy function. Minimizing it preserves
	details in a least-squares sense, distributing error uniformly over
	the whole deformed mesh. It can also be combined with conventional
	constraints involving surface positions, details or smoothness, and
	efficiently minimized by solving a sparse linear system.We apply
	this technique in a 2D curve-based deformation system allowing novice
	users to create pleasing deformations with little effort. A novel

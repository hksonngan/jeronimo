\begin_layout Abstract
This paper proposes a novel method for modelling poligonal mesh using curvature
 enhancing.
 This method use our proposes of laplacian operator extension for triangles
 and quads meshes to enhance global curvature in the model.
 This work show novel applications of curvature enhancing in sculpting and
 modelling with subdivison surfaces and weigth vertex groups.
 We show a series of graphics examples that demonstrate the quality, predictabil
ity and flexibility of our results in a real production environment with
 software blender.

 Our work present an extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator for meshes
 of arbitrary topology composed for triangles and quads representing a larger
 spectrum of mesh that works with today eliminating the need for preprocessing
 and allows the preservation of the original topology.
 With this operator we proposed a method to generate family of parameterized
 shapes, in a robust and predictable way.
 Our method enable to customizate of smoothnes and curvature obtaining during
 subdivision surfaces process.
 We proposed a new brush for enhance sillouet features of mesh in modelling
 and sculpting.

Many tools have been developed for modeling based on Laplacian mesh processing.
 Thanks to the kindness of the Laplacian operator these tools have in common
 the need for preservation of the geometric details of the surface for the

Methods for offset polygon meshes based on the curvature defined by the
 Laplace Beltrami operator have been developed.
 These methods allow adjusting shape offset by a constant distance with
 high enough precision to minimize Hausdorf error.
 The problem with these methods is the loss of detail caused by smoothing,
 which depends on the size of the offset

, and angle-based threshold.
 In feature characterization step the curves are classified by several propertie
s as planar or non-planar, approximated by line, circle or ellipse shapes,
 and so on.
 In edit step the user define initial change over several feature and then
 this edit is propagated over other features with base in your inter-relationshi
ps.
 This method works fine with objects that have sharp edges composed of basic
 geometric shapes such as lines, circles or ellipses but this method has
 difficulties when models are smoother with organic forms and cannot find
 the features to edit and preserve.

The Laplacian Smooth techniques allows you to reduce noise on a mesh's surface
 with minimal changes on its shape.
 Computer graphics objects which have been reconstructed from real world,
 contain undesirable noise.
 A laplacian smoothing removes undesirable noise while still preserves desirable

 Generating a parameterized family of shapes using a set of vertices representin
g a coarse sketch of the desired model.
 Our approach can be mixed with traditional or uniform subdivision surfaces
 methods and is iterative and converges towards a continuous and smooth
 version of the original model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other methods, our method allows to use mixed arbitrary types of
 mesh representation as triangles and quads, exploiting the basic geometrical
 relationships facilitating and ensuring convergence of the algorithm and
 similar shapes consistent with the original shape against the other methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our method allows the use of soft constraints weighting the effect of smoothing
 at each vertex based on a normalized weight, the weights are assigned to
 the control vertices of the original mesh or.
 The weights of the new vertices resulting from the subdivisions are calculated
 by interpolation, allowing to modify the behavior of the method on exact
 regions of the original model.

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach contain an extension of the Laplace Beltrami operator for meshes
 composed by triangles and quads.
 Using meshes composed by triangles and quads has been increasing in recent
 years due to the flexibility of modeling tools as Blender 3D

Brochas que realizan trabajos similares como la brocha de inflacion, crean
 problemas en el modelo pues al aplicarlo se pueden producir autointersecciones

 la mejor manera de realizar la inflacion mientras conservar las curvaturas
 que le dan la apariencia caracteristica a ese objeto.
\end_layout

Nuestro metodo simplifica el trabajo que se requiere para realizar el realce
 que consistiria en usar algunos brocas diferentes algunas para inflar y
 otras para suavizar y estilizar.
 con nuestra brocha este tipo de realces se pueden realizar en un solo paso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Para que la brocha trabaje en tiempo real es necesario que cuando se construya
 la matriz con los vertices solo sean tomados encuenta aquellos vertices
 que estan dentro del radio de afectacion definido por el usuario lo cual
 reduce drasticamente el tamaño de los vertices a procesar, el centro de
 esta esfera depende del lugar donde el usuario haga click en el canvas
 y el lugar tridimensional en el modelo donde el click se proyecta.
 Es necesario ademas realizar una cambio con los vertices que se encuentran
 en la frontera los cuales tienen vecinos que nos se encuentran dentro del
 radio de afectacion estos vertices seran marcados como de frontera y en
 ellos no se calculara el laplaciano perso estaran presentes en el sistema
 lineal de forma invariante para permitir que los vertices que tengan todos
 sus vecinos en el interior del radio de afectacion puedan calcular de forma
 correcta la curvatura, este cambio permite que los resultados sean mucho
 mas suaves en la frontera.

\begin_layout Standard
Los pesos pueden ser aplicados sobre el modelo tosco y luego al realizan
 subdivision estos pesos son suavizados de forma que produce resultados
 con cambios suaves en las zonas de influencia donde se aplica el laplaciano,
 en la formaula xy, donde Wp es una matriz diagonal con los pesos correspondient
es para cada vertice, ver imagen xyz.
 Los pesos sobre cada vertice produciran una solucion diferente por esa
 razon son puestos antes de obtener la solucion del sistema lineal.
 Las familias que se generan pueden cambiar substancialmente con el ponderamient
o de puntos de control especificos.

 show the generation of diferent version of camel with the variation of
 parameter lambda.
 In the top row you can see results of do curvature enhance over all model,
 a medida que el lambda se hace mas negativo la curvatura del modelo tiende
 a cerrarse e intersectarse en las partes concavas y a inflarse en las partes
 convexas como se observa en la imagen 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We use negative values to enhance model silhouette features, entre mas
 negativo sea el lambda mas realce sufriran las siluetas features.
 En la fila de abajo de la figura 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 se puede obervar el uso de vertex weigthed groups, que permite especificar
 en que zonas del modelo desea realizar el realce, en la parte izquierda
 se observa el realce de las patas del camello que produce un realce de
 aspecto organico , tambien se observa que la frontera no se distorsiona
 y es bastante suave la union de la parte realzada con el resto.

Nosotros realizamos pruebas del operador laplaciano con la ecuacion (

) y su version normalizada ecuacion (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:TQLBO-Normalized_Matrix"

\end_inset

), las dos producen resultados similares si los triangulos que componen
 la malla son del mismo tama;o en promedio, pero la version normalizada
 es mucho mas estable y predecible, debido a que no es dividida por el area
 del anillo que puede producir problemas de calculo debido a erroreres de
 punto flotante como se observa en la figura 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 (c) bottom row en la cual la malla se deformo pues el TQLBO es suceptible
 al tamaño de los triangulo.
 El realce de curvatura con el laplaciano normalizado tiene un comportamiento
 mas regular.
 El modelo se puede deformar en la version normalizada del TQLBO con lambdas
 grandes > 400 se autointersecta, pero no produce los picos que se observan
 con el TQLBO.
 En la figura 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:(a)Monkey"

\end_inset

 se observan resultads diferentes debido a que el area de los triangulos
 en este modelo no es regular de manera que donde hay triangulos de mayor
 area el realce es menor (figura 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:(a)Monkey"

\end_inset

 (c) skull), y donde los triangulos son mas pequenios se produce un realce
 mayor (figura

 (c) chin).

Nuestro metodo para realizar el realce de las silouete features es predecible
 e invariante frente a transformaciones isometricas como las presentes en
 animaciones, en esta animacion se muestran algunas poses del camello realizando
 una caminata.
 En esta animacion las patas y el cuello son las partes que se les realiza
 en realce como se observa en la parte izquierda abajo de la figura
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Animated_Camell"

\end_inset

.
 Modificaciones locales producidas con metodos como pose interpolation or
 rigging animation no afectan significativamente el resultado como en el
 caso de las patas del camello cada pose muestra una flexion diferente de
 las articulaciones de las patas del camello el realce permite mantener
 flesh-like shapes producidas en el modelo original por el artista.
 Esto se debe al proceso de difusion al cual es sometida la malla de forma
 que peque;os cambios locales son tratados globalmente sin que afecte significat
ivamente la solucion.
 Nuestro metodo es invariante de rotacion pues unicamente depende del normal
 field of the mesh, wish is invariant under global rotations.

 (b) se observa como en la parte de arriba la pata del camello se autointersecta
 y se observa como dos burbujas pegadas lo mismo sucede con los dedos de
 la mano en la parte de abajo.
 Con el uso del realce de silouete features en la figura 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sculpt_Brush"

\end_inset

 (c) vemos resultados mejores pues no se perdio la forma de la silueta y
 se conservaron los detalles de los dedos y la pata.
 Resultados similares pueden ser oobtenidos por un artista pero le tomaria
 varios pasos y el uso de varias brocas con el realce de curvaturas solo
 toma un paso.
 Con esta nueva tecnica se pueden realzar facilmente los musculos en personajes
 organicos durante el proceso de sculpting.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Para mejorar el rendimiento se trabajo con la mesh struct de bajo nivel
 de blender calculando todos los datos posible por cada triangle or quad
 visited y sumandolos a su correspondiente indice en una lista que almacenaba
 la suma de los laplacianos del anillo, de esta manera solo se debia recorrer
 dos veces la lista de caras del modelo y dos veces la lista de bordes si
 la malla no era cerrada.
 Para la brush fue necesario crear una lista que mapeara los indices de
 los vertices seleccionados a una lista de 1 a N donde N es el numero de
 vertices selecccionados y tambien el numero de filas en el sistema lineal
 a resolver, con esto se reducian drasticamente los calculos que se debian
 realizar permitiendo trabajar con la herramienta en tiempo real.
 En la construccion de nuestro matri laplaciana se bloquearon lo vertices
 que tenian caras o bordes vecinos con areas o bordes valor 0 que pueden
 provocar picos y malos resultados.

La matrix

 en la malla.
 Para resolver el sistema lineal de la ecuacion

Nosotros presentamos una extension del operador laplace beltrami para triangulos

 conversion que ofrece resultados similares a los que se obtendrian al trabajar
 unicamente con triangulos o con cuadrados.
 Nosotros contribuimos el concepto de realce de las siluetas en una malla

 la modificacion de la curvatura de un modelo manteniendo su forma general.

\begin_layout Standard
Nosotros introducimos una nueva metodo de modelamiento y mostramos algunos
 de sus posibles usos.
 Mostramos que el metodo se comporta de forma predecible lo cual facilitara
 los procesos de aprendizaje, ademas se demostro que el metodo trabaja bien
 con transformaciones isometricas abriendo la posibilidad de introducirlo
 en las etapas de animacion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nosotros demostramos que esta herramienta sirve para trabjar en las primeras
 etapas en la que se usan coarse models modificando la curvatura generada
 por la sub de sup con cc, evitando la edicion de los vertices al tener
 unicamente que cambiar unos pocos parametros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Como trabajo futuro nos gustaria analizar teoricamente la relacion entre
 la subdivision de superficies con catmull clark y el suavizado laplaciano
 dado que en algunos casos pueden producir resultados muy similares pero
 la subdivision con catmull es un metodo muy rapido lo que permitiria reducir
 los tiempos de calculo para obtener la curvatura en un modelo.
